I pretty much copied the video and completed the homework in Wk5HW, having some trouble because I chose to make a menu of classes and students because I'm a former teacher. I had to be careful not to use the word class except where it was only being viewed by the user.  It works though!

Anyway, I went back to try to make one more my own and made a menu for a Christmas list.  You can put in children and create their present list.
